# LSU-REU-CODE
GWpy script for my summer work at LSU.

This code looks for noise transients in the Advanced LIGO time-dependent calibration model. The Advanced LIGO calibration model uses injected sinusoidal excitations to measure and track the various transfer functions that keep the interferometer in resonance. This code demodulates LIGO data in an effort to calculate the time-dependent calibration parameters when given user-defined factors such as start time, end time, and upper frequency of measurement. With this, transients in the time-dependnet calibration parameters can be looked for at various dates throughout the second observing run of LIGO.
